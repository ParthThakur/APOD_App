# APOD_App
A python GUI app to preview and download Images from apod.nasa.gov

Functions that don't work currently:
  1. Certain dates will crash the program. This is because APOD uploaded a video on that date, and I havent added redundancies for them.
     Check list of known dates to crash the program below.
  2. The app can only display one image at a time. To get another image, a restart is required.
  3. The app will freeze while downloading the preview and the image.
  

List of known dates to crash app:
  05/03/2018
  26/02/2018
